Oh, goddamn it, youve got to be fucking kidding me, former Triumph traveler Laura Jackson said as torrents of human waste rose around her ankles and soiled her newly changed clothing. You know what? Bring it on. Just go ahead and pour shit all over me. Lock me in a Porta-Potty and roll me down a hill, see if I give a fuck. Screw it.

'Citizens are frantically trying to get rid of their worthless rubles, our nuclear weapons are sitting unguarded in abandoned silos, and the mentally unstable Boris Yeltsin, who is scheduled to undergo octuple-bypass surgery next week, refuses to step down.

Almost all of them will vote Democrat, so you can see the motivation there, Tucker Carlson of Fox Friends commented. What theyre doing is a full-court press on getting these aliens9 million of themregistered as citizens in time for the 2016 election, added Former Justice Department official J. Christian Adams. They are redirecting resources of DHS to this effort, this campaign. In fact, an internal memo from the DHS Task Force even admits this is being done for political purposes. What do you think?

Oh, goddamn it, youve got to be fucking kidding me, former Triumph traveler Laura Jackson said as torrents of human waste rose around her ankles and soiled her newly changed clothing. You know what? Bring it on. Just go ahead and pour shit all over me. Lock me in a Porta-Potty and roll me down a hill, see if I give a fuck. Screw it.

'Citizens are frantically trying to get rid of their worthless rubles, our nuclear weapons are sitting unguarded in abandoned silos, and the mentally unstable Boris Yeltsin, who is scheduled to undergo octuple-bypass surgery next week, refuses to step down.

Almost all of them will vote Democrat, so you can see the motivation there, Tucker Carlson of Fox Friends commented. What theyre doing is a full-court press on getting these aliens9 million of themregistered as citizens in time for the 2016 election, added Former Justice Department official J. Christian Adams.

Carrying a placard saying 'Nukiller Power No', the man was bundled off the stage by security staff at Methodist Central Hall, where Brown spoke along with his Conservative and Liberal Democrat rivals for elections this week. 'I'm used to worse,' joked Brown, after organisers of the gathering of non- governmental organisations (NGOs) apologised for the disturbance. 'You may have been in the House of Commons sometimes,' he added. The incident came with only three days to go until Thursday's general election in which Brown is struggling to cling on to power despite polls showing opposition Conservatives in the lead in knife-edge ballots. Brown spoke at the meeting after addresses by Conservative leader David Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, whose party has leapfrogged Labour into second place in opinion polls during the month-long campaign. \",\n          \"US safety officials Wednesday urged parents to stop using infant sleep positioners, which claim to keep sleeping babies from rolling onto their stomachs, because they can be deadly. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Food and Drug Administration warned parents and child care providers to stop using the bolster pillows, saying they have received a dozen reports of infants between the ages of one and four months who died using the devices. Most of the infants suffocated and died after rolling from a side-sleeping position onto their stomachs, but others suffocated after becoming trapped between the sleep positioner and the side of their bed. In addition to the deaths, the CPSC has received dozens of reports of infants who were placed on their backs or sides in sleep positioners, only to be found later in potentially hazardous positions in or next to them. The deaths and incidents involving sleep positioners happened over a period of 13 years, the two agencies said. 'We urge parents and caregivers to take our warning seriously and stop using these sleep positioners, so that children can have a safer sleep,' CPSC chairwoman Inez Tenenbaum said. The two main types of infant sleep positioners are flat mats with side bolsters or wedge mats with side bolsters. They are supposed to keep an infant from rolling onto his or her back while sleeping, to avoid SIDS, which has been linked to stomach-sleeping. The FDA said Wednesday that there is no evidence that the devices prevent SIDS and urged parents, health care professionals, and childcare providers to stop using them. It also ordered manufacturers of infant sleep positioners with medical claims that have not been reviewed by the FDA to stop marketing those products, and asked manufacturers whose sleep positioners have been cleared by the FDA to submit clinical data showing that their products' benefits outweigh any risks. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is Wong's third gold medal in the road cycling event in four National Games. 'The route is a typical mountain road,' Hong Kong team coach, Shen Jinkang, said. 'It is more difficult than all the previous National Games and any other one-day race of inter-continental competitions.' Only 34 cyclists out of 74 completed Monday's race which was filled with hills and crosswind. Wong finished in five hours 35 minutes and nine seconds, two seconds faster than the runner-up, Chinese Army's Ma Haijun. Li Fuyu from host Shandong Province took the third with 5:35:12. 'It is my last National Games,' the 36-year-old Wong said after the journey, who still looks to compete in the 2012 London Olympics. 'I think I will retire after the London Olympics, and I hope Hong Kong's young cyclists may catch up and get more medals in the future,' he said. \",\n          \" A clear message has been delivered by Chuck Norris: if you cross him, you'll surely hear about it. The recent incident of a Texas man being asked to remove his flag by his landlord, who considered it a threat to the Muslim community, was the last straw for Norris. This followed an incident where a veteran in Florida was fined $8,000 for flying a flag in his yard. Norris questioned the public, \\\"Do you recall the time when Americans were not only proud to display the Old Glory but also disapproved of neighbors who didn't?\\\" He urged everyone to fly the flag proudly and use the opportunity to remind family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors of its significance. In fact, what is unfortunate is that there seems to be some embarrassment surrounding what the United States represents. Many people are starting to view the United States as an aggressor instead of a liberator. These flag-flying incidents would not be so disheartening if they weren't becoming so common and indicative of a United States that has strayed from its original purpose and the intentions of its founders. Let us not hesitate for a moment to place our hand over our heart and declare loudly and proudly for all to hear: \\\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\\"</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Mexican electricians union, on the other hand, says that when Calderon ordered police to seize Luz y Fuerza del Centro on Oct. 10, it was baldly political: He hoped to break the union representing 66,000 current and retired employees and weaken his rival, leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whom the union backed. In fact, there's truth in both arguments, and both are good for Calderon. If it survives legal challenges, the move will allow him to dispense with an inefficient company that bedeviled his predecessors while busting a union long regarded as corrupt and hostile to his presidency. Luz y Fuerza, or Light and Power, seemed to operate in multiples of three. The company lost a third of its electricity to 'theft, technical failures, corruption or inefficiency,' Calderon said. Union featherbedding resulted in three times as many employees per customer as the state-run Federal Electricity Commission, which supplies energy to the rest of the country and has been given the business of the disbanded company. Retirees earned pensions three times greater than the take-home pay of active employees. Since Calderon's decree, the union has turned out tens of thousands of demonstrators to protest the 'authoritarian' decision. But there also was support for the liquidation among ratepayers fed up with poor service and alleged fraud in the re-election of union boss Martin Esparza. Many Mexicans are tired of a lack of public accountability -- for union dues or government funds -- and welcomed the move. But experience tells Mexicans to beware of hidden agendas. Many suspect that breaking this union was a precursor to privatizing electricity in the hands of foreigners or friends of Calderon, as was the case previously with banks and television. It would be a terrible mistake for the government to perpetuate a system of crony capitalism that has cost the state legitimacy and created monopolies impeding economic growth. Instead, many Mexicans are asking whether Calderon will go after corruption in other unions, notably ones that have backed him. Doing so would go a long way toward convincing his countrymen that the dissolution of the electricity company was more about pesos than politics. \",\n          \" A tow truck operator in North Carolina recently gained attention for declining to assist a woman whose car had broken down on the highway. The woman, 25-year-old Cassy McWade, had contacted a local mechanic for help. When Ken Shupe of Shupe Max Towing arrived to tow her vehicle to the garage for repairs, she was initially grateful. However, her relief turned to disbelief when he noticed her bumper sticker supporting Bernie Sanders and decided to leave. Shupe allegedly told McWade, \\\"I can't tow you; you're a Bernie supporter.\\\" McWade replied, \\\"Are you serious? You're kidding me.\\\" What are your thoughts on this situation? Do you think the tow truck driver acted appropriately, or did he go too far?</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The Department of Rapid Transit intends to create yellow and brown lines to integrate the metro system into a complete public transportation network. These lines will pass through popular commercial, leisure, and scenic areas in the city, ending at Chengching Lake in Kaohsiung County. The existing Red Line and Orange Line intersect at the Formosa Boulevard Station, but the department believes this is not enough to make it a comprehensive network. They have allocated NT$16 million this year to hire a consultancy firm to plan the routes of the two new lines to aid the government's initiative to promote the system. The yellow line, beginning at a major shopping center in Kaohsiung, will be 14.3 km long and is estimated to cost NT$11.5 billion. The brown line, starting from a wharf near Kaohsiung Harbor, will end at Chengching Lake, spanning 11.29 km, and is estimated to cost around NT$9 billion. Meanwhile, expansion plans for the existing two lines have been completed and submitted for review. The Red Line will be extended 9.8 km to Kaohsiung Science Park, while the Orange Line will be extended 14.04 km to Pingtung City, with a combined projected cost of NT$49.9 billion. The north-south Red Line and east-west Orange Line were launched in March and September last year, respectively. However, the system's finances have been negatively affected due to low passenger volume. To address the financial shortfall, the company has planned to increase passenger volume by 30% to 150,000 and reduce operating costs by 10%. The Kaohsiung MRT was constructed on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis, costing NT$181.3 billion and covering a total of 42.7 km.</s>\",\n          \"Trey Gowdy Makes Major Announcement About His Plans For Hillary, Your Going To Love This For some time know, Congressman Trey Gowdy has proven himself to be a true protector of justice. Though he continues to represent his district in South Carolina, many speculate he will also play a role within the Donald Trump Administration. Trump only propelled these rumors when he named Gowdy as an executive member of his Presidential transition team. It also led people to wonder how it would impact Gowdys current duties as a congressman and his efforts into the Hillary Clinton investigation. Fortunately, Gowdy has confirmed he has no intention of putting Clintons case on the back burner. In fact, hes only been ramping up his efforts to hold the former Secretary of State accountable for her actions. Hes also holding Obamas feet to the fire. It is also riddled with factual inaccuracies, which not only does a disservice to the public but also does a disservice to the women and men who work for the Department of Defense, Gowdy said of Obamas report on Benghazi. What do you think? Do you applaud Gowdy for continuing to fight for justice? \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This declaration was made in response to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's claim that Iran's plan is a political ploy and that they lack the capacity to enrich uranium to 20%. Kouchner also accused Tehran of coercion. Salehi had previously announced that Iran would initiate the enrichment of uranium to 20% under the watchful eye of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors on Tuesday. He added that the enriched uranium would be transformed into fuel plates for the Tehran research reactor. On Tuesday, it was reported by Press TV that Iran had started enriching uranium to 20% at its Natanz enrichment facility, with IAEA inspectors present. On Monday, Iran notified the IAEA of its intention to produce 20% enriched uranium, prompting fresh threats of new sanctions from France and the United States.</s>\",\n          \"Four southern Mexican states were drenched by the remnants of Tropical Storm Matthew on Monday, the National Water Commision (CONAGUA) said. State Chiapas was worst hit with 257 mm of rain, followed by neighboring Oaxaca with 191 mm, and Gulf of Mexico state Veracruz with 182 mm. Tabasco was comparatively less hit with 101 mm of rain, the agency said in a statement. CONAGUA also published a photo of Matthew changing into multiple small storms mainly over Tabasco and Chiapas on its website, and it suggested people living along riverside on the boundary between the two states move to higher ground as the water 'will rise very rapidly.' The storm, which is already weakened, passed through Central American country Nicaragua on Friday and made landfalls there.

Instead, Emily Blunt has a face that sticks. Her eyes are large, observant. Her wide mouth can deliver delight or a bitter line. A cleft dimples her chin. When the British actress arrived on the scene, it was atop a white horse in the 2004 indie 'My Summer of Love.' Heroine Mona was smitten with Blunt's bold, inscrutable Tamsin. As were audiences at the Toronto Film Festival, where Pawel Pawlikowski's film premiered. In a short five years, Blunt has gone from holding those reins to reigning over an empire as 'The Young Victoria,' written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Jean-Marc Vallee. The film opens Christmas Day. At the start of the year, the 26-year-old appeared opposite Amy Adams in 'Sunshine Cleaning,' a dramedy about two sisters who begin a crime-scene-cleaning biz in New Mexico. Blunt's Nora is impulsive and terrifically irresponsible. Last week, Blunt was nominated for a Golden Globe for her turn as a bearer of the weightiest sort of responsibilities, a nation's interests. (She already has one for her supporting role in the 2007 BBC miniseries, 'Gideon's Daughter.' That same year she was nominated for her turn in 'The Devil Wears Prada.') Victoria is her first starring role. 'It was a little daunting,' Blunt said by phone about her leap. 'I felt scared by the thought of it. But then, the experience of it was another thing altogether. It was wonderful and exhilarating. Jean-Marc created such an atmospheric set that moved so quickly, I didn't have time to realize I might have to be carrying a film.' In one of the film's fine moments, the recently crowned monarch lies in bed staring. She is replaying something her trusted adviser Lord Melbourne said to her regarding her cousin Prince Albert, who is gently courting her. It is often the simple shots that are the most difficult to perform. Looking out into space, looking out at us, Blunt captures a variety of feelings: doubt, stubbornness, fondness. She reveals the young queen's mind. In her eyes is the near-imperceptible vibration of fear, but more possibility. 'She's a wonderful character at the end of the day, and I wanted to do her justice, rather than just the fact she reigned England,' Blunt said. 'I was very taken in by her, by the way she saw the world. I think she saw the world in quite a different light from the women of her time. The image of her was so dour. But when she was young, she was this kind of spitfire.' In the year leading up to her crowning, her mother, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson), and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) had been working to get Victoria to sign over her duties to a regent. They failed. But even as queen, she is pulled and pushed by allies. Melbourne (Paul Bettany) tries to plant a seed of suspicion about Albert. It doesn't take root. And 'The Young Victoria' is an engaging love story. Rupert Friend plays Albert. The actor proves a terrific partner in this romance. 'You're only as good as your co-star,' Blunt said modestly. But that cuts both ways. Friend blossoms in this role, to the point where we can't imagine Victoria (or the movie) without him. Of course, that is the Queen Victoria most of us know: the one bereft of Albert, clad in black. 'We show why she grieved him so ferociously,' Blunt said. 'I think it literally burst an existential bubble of happiness she was in and she never recovered.' Thankfully, long before that heartbreak arrives, Blunt gives a vibrant portrait of a woman living with the machinations of a court and in the magnificence of a courtship. On Christmas Day, Blunt and fianc? John Krasinski ('The Office') have hers-and-his openings. (He's sweetly hysterical as Meryl Streep's son-in-law in 'It's Complicated.') After 'The Young Victoria' comes the horror redux 'The Wolf Man,' with Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. 'I am quite an immediate person,' she said. 'I don't look for the next thing, the next thing and the next thing, because I find that overwhelming. But I don't stare at the ground, either. I'm very curious about the world. I'm very curious about where this job will take me.' \",\n          \"Amy Grants Previous Kids Didnt Accept Vince, But What One Daughter Did Changed EVERYTHING Vince Gill and Amy Grant have been married for more than 16 years. They are two of the most talented musicians in all of country music. Amy Grants three children from her previous marriage struggled to accept Gill as a member of their family. They did not see a reason to given that they had their own father. It was not until one thing that the family truly came together. That one thing was the birth of Corrina Gill. She is the only daughter of the two superstars together. Gill said that she is the glue of the family, and is the reason they feel so bonded now. Corrina could not have come at a better time, because both Vince and Amy were about to release new albums. The two parents went on tour soon after, but raised their kids right. The entire Gill family is immensely talented. On numerous occasions Vince and Amy have brought their daughters on stage with them. One time Corrina performed on stage at the Grand Ole Opry with her father. Her sister, Jenny, has also joined their father on stage. Corrina is the only daughter to join Amy on stage. Two of Amys other daughters are in a band together. The Gill family is unbelievably talented.

A song and a digital library dedicated to this occasion. Even a bird and a plant have been named for the bicentennial. Of course, there will be a grand fireworks display, planned to be the largest the country has ever seen. However, the enthusiasm usually associated with such events seems to be missing. With Mexico approaching the 200th anniversary of its rebellion against Spain, the national mood is at its lowest in years. A drug war that has taken more than 28,000 lives and seeped into previously peaceful areas has dampened the spirit. Safety concerns have led to the cancellation of bicentennial fireworks in several towns, including Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso. Major commemorative projects, including the bicentennial monument, the Estela de Luz, will not be completed in time. A poll found tepid support for the government's celebration, with critics suggesting that the funds could be better spent on social needs. Despite the lack of enthusiasm, the government expects a large turnout for the celebration in Mexico City's historic Zocalo, where a series of spectacles are planned for Wednesday night. The aim is to create a memorable celebration, with dancing, an aerial acrobatic show, and performances by popular artists like Tigres del Norte. While unity may be a challenge in a country with diverse regions, there are those who feel a sense of pride as independence day approaches.</s>\",\n          \"WATCH: Thug Wont Shut Up, So Judge Says 2 Words That Leave Him Whimpering On The Floor [VIDEO] When this 27-year-old thug decided to pick a fight with the judge hearing his defense, he learned a very important lesson about justice. Its probably not a good idea to be arguing with someone who hold your fate in their hands. Saamir Jhaled Khaleel Kingali was representing himself in court in July for unlawful possession of a firearm. Judge Robert C. Nalley grew increasingly frustrated with him when Kingali ignored his orders to stop speaking. When Kingali refused to follow Nalleys orders, he finally ordered a court deputy to Do it. The deputy them activated a stun-cuff Kingali was wearing, administering 50,000 volts to the criminal, who quickly fell to the floor in pain. The action may seem extreme to some, but Kingali had a history of disruptive courtroom behavior, including a previous incident when he attempted to run out of the courthouse. 72-year-old Nalley was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine in a Thursday civil rights case for making the order. He is also sentenced to participate in anger-management classes, and will be required to spend a year on probation for his actions. It should be recognized that Kigali said the incident was torture and a very dehumanizing experience.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

'Lofton loves competitionhe'll try to beat you any way he can,' Lundquist said of Lofton, whose function on the team is to produce points while preventing the other team from doing so in turn. 'He's just one of those athletes who really wants to win and hates to lose.'

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe. After theyre here, like theVicious Snake, they bite, they rape, they steal, they dump miles and miles of trash on our landscapes and in our city streets. They will and do resort to crime and proclaim jihad on American soil. The cunning nature of this vicious snake (Obama) just ate up our citizens dreams, values and and security. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe. After theyre here, like theVicious Snake, they bite, they rape, they steal, they dump miles and miles of trash on our landscapes and in our city streets. They will and do resort to crime and proclaim jihad on American soil. The cunning nature of this vicious snake (Obama) just ate up our citizens dreams, values and and security. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has_swear_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"severity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5984297674476382,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 51.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 51,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12.6,\n          15.2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe. After theyre here, like theVicious Snake, they bite, they rape, they steal, they dump miles and miles of trash on our landscapes and in our city streets. They will and do resort to crime and proclaim jihad on American soil. The cunning nature of this vicious snake (Obama) just ate up our citizens dreams, values and and security. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has_swear_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true,\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"severity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.5984297674476382,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 51.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 51,\n        \"samples\": [\n          12.6,\n          15.2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe. After theyre here, like theVicious Snake, they bite, they rape, they steal, they dump miles and miles of trash on our landscapes and in our city streets. They will and do resort to crime and proclaim jihad on American soil. The cunning nature of this vicious snake (Obama) just ate up our citizens dreams, values and and security. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Original Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He tweeted a suggestion to his followers on Friday. Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, the most overrated person on tv. Officials at Fox did not let the comment go unnoticed. A spokesperson from the network issued a response. Donald Trumps vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land. He then added further reassurance of Foxs stance. Megyn is an exemplary journalist and one of the leading anchors in America were extremely proud of her phenomenal work and continue to fully support her throughout every day of Trumps endless barrage of crude and sexist verbal assaults.As the mother of three young children, with a successful law career and the second highest rated show in cable television, its especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job. The spokesman wasnt the only person to chime in on Trumps comment. Bret Baier, Kellys colleague, posted an opinion. Enough. @megynkelly is not crazy-shes not sick. Well continue to cover this race fairly. Even Geraldo Rivera was upset enough to tweet an answer. @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly I love you man but basta. This obsession w @megynkelly is weird unhelpful. Shes doing her job, you do yours. Amen, Mr. Rivera. Trump has been barraging Megyn Kelly with negativity since the first Republican presidential debate. Kelly upset the Donald by asking him about some his past statements about women. Since then, he has continually made his displeasure known. He even went so far as to skip one the debates because she was the moderator.

            "1009    Fox: Trump Has Extreme, Sick OBSESSION Yet, again, Donald Trump has taken public his unending dislike of Megyn Kelly. He tweeted a suggestion to his followers on Friday. Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, the most overrated person on tv. Officials at Fox did not let the comment go unnoticed. A spokesperson from the network issued a response. Donald Trumps vitriolic attacks against Megyn Kelly and his extreme, sick obsession with her is beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate who wants to occupy the highest office in the land. He then added further reassurance of Foxs stance. Megyn is an exemplary journalist and one of the leading anchors in America were extremely proud of her phenomenal work and continue to fully support her throughout every day of Trumps endless barrage of crude and sexist verbal assaults.As the mother of three young children, with a successful law career and the second highest rated show in cable television, its especially deplorable for her to be repeatedly abused just for doing her job. The spokesman wasnt the only person to chime in on Trumps comment. Bret Baier, Kellys colleague, posted an opinion. Enough. @megynkelly is not crazy-shes not sick. Well continue to cover this race fairly. Even Geraldo Rivera was upset enough to tweet an answer. @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly I love you man but basta. This obsession w @megynkelly is weird unhelpful. Shes doing her job, you do yours. Amen, Mr. Rivera. Trump has been barraging Megyn Kelly with negativity since the first Republican presidential debate. Kelly upset the Donald by asking him about some his past statements about women. Since then, he has continually made his displeasure known. He even went so far as to skip one the debates because she was the moderator. If Trump truly wants to be Commander in Chief, maybe he should try following the military saying: Suck it up. Press on. 2016 Vianna Vaughan source: MSN \n",

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe.

kentucky ) said today that he believes he has a secret weapon that will derail hillary clintons 2016 white house bid : a little - known affair between her husband and a white house intern, monica lewinsky. appearing on the fox news channel, paul told the host sean hannity, sean, when the american people find out about this scandal, they are going to be shocked, truly shocked. it didnt get a lot of coverage at the time. asked by hannity how the scandal could have remained under wraps for so long, paul replied, youll have to ask bill and hillary that. lets just say theyve pulled a lot of strings to keep this story out of the mainstream media. unfortunately for them, sean, i have the details on this juicy scandal and im prepared to share them with the american people, he said. i think its going to be a game - changer. while he believes that the shocking revelations about president clintons oval office dalliances will be enough to destroy hillarys 2016 ambitions, paul confirmed that he has other arrows in his quiver. it turns out that hillary was involved in a business deal called whitewater, he said. when the american people find out about this, its going to blow their minds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \",\n          \" the commonwealth games were supposed to be india's grand coming - out party, an audition for a potential olympic bid and a chance to show off its rising status as a superpower and serious rival to china. but for all of india's high hopes, the games have become a source of national shame. allegations of fraud, construction delays, budget overruns and security concerns have plagued the games for months. then a series of incidents this week - including a bridge collapse and descriptions of the athletes'living quarters as filthy - added to india's troubles. even the theme song for the games was deemed disappointing. instead of looking scrubbed and polished, roads in the capital are still dug up, piles of rubble hiding unfinished work in what has become a symbol of the gaps between india's aspirations and the realities on the ground. more than 7, 000 athletes from 71 nations of the former british empire are supposed to arrive here by friday for the oct. 3 - 14 games. but some have announced plans to withdraw, and new zealand and canada joined scotland on thursday in taking a wait - and - see approach.'the games are officially a disaster. the people of india feel dejected. instead of boosting our profile, we are now objects of pity around the world,'said boria majumdar, a sports historian who has written a national bestseller about the games.'we have lost our chance at an olympic bid for 2020. who will trust india now?'the centerpiece of a jaw - dropping opening ceremony - a $ 12 million helium balloon - is being hastily rejiggered because of an equipment malfunction, an official said. a smaller inner balloon, fitted with cameras to project images of 5, 000 years of indian culture and india's economic rise, burst in torrential rains and lightning.'now it is just a big expensive balloon,'sighed the official. adding to india's headache, this year's monsoon rains have been the worst in decades. an outbreak of dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, has killed five people and sickened 2, 500 in the capital. india's health minister, gulam nabi azad, said pools of dirty water around construction sites'have become a breeding place for mosquitoes.'delhi state government's health minister announced in august that the army would be called in to remove stagnate water from the athletes'village. but the government, worried that the army's presence would create panic, decided against the plan. \",\n          \" a female belgian skydiver went on trial for murder friday, accused of allegedly killing the woman who was both her good friend and her lover's paramour by sabotaging the woman's parachute. the prosecutors said jealousy drove els clottemans to kill els van doren four years ago by turning their shared passion for skydiving into a murder weapon. clottemans, 26, has vehemently denied the murder charges and accusations that she killed van doren so she could have the man, another dutch skydiver, all to herself. belgian privacy laws make it impossible to identify him. the case has captured the imagination of this nation since van doren fell from 13, 000 feet ( 4, 500 meters ) into a suburban garden in eastern belgium after both her parachute and her reserve parachute did not open on nov. 18, 2006. a married mother of two and an experienced skydiving enthusiast, van doren had jumped from a plane together with clottemans, their dutch lover and another skydiver intending to perform tricks in the sky. clottemans, however, jumped a fraction too late and did not join the maneuvers with the other three. when the sign was given to open the parachutes, van doren struggled with her cords before hurling toward the ground. clottemans became a prime suspect when she attempted suicide hours before she was to make a second statement to police a month after the incident. the investigation revealed that clottemans had a relationship with the same skydiver as van doren. prosecutors allege that clottemans had tampered with van doren's parachute and cut two vital cords before the jump. no hard evidence has surfaced so far to support the murder charge, but prosecutors hope the circumstantial links will secure a conviction. chief defense lawyer vic van aelst said prosecutors'have nothing'to tie his client to the death.'they have to prove they have something, but they have been trying to do it for four years and it is not going very well for them,'vic van aelst said. the trial opened friday with jury selection and is expected to last a month. media interest was so extensive that authorities used a room next to the courthouse so journalists could follow the proceedings through remote video.                                            \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Original Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          4,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          3,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

All those millions of men looking to have affairs, Im afraid theres some more embarrassing and bad news. Now that the Ashley Madison hack data dump is putting names with profiles, wrecking marriages and reputations, and prompting some disgraced former pillars of the community to confess or commit suicide, the most ironic twist comes out. Most of the profiles of women on the site are pure memorex. From the Washington Post: Ashley Madison has long claimed, in triumphant news releases and slick, Web-ready graphics, that it is one of the few dating sites that really clicks with women. According to statistics CEO NoelBiderman has trumpeted in the media, Ashley Madison enjoys an overall 70/30 gender split with a 1:1 male/female ratio among the under-30 set. But the user records laid bare by hackers last week tell a very different story: Of the more than 35 million records released, only 5 million a mere 15 percent actually belonged to women. So, thats 30 million men looking to cheat, with 5 million women to share between them, most of whom might well be prostitutes, if the entity responsible for the hack is to be believed. Theres a certain amount of poetic justice in that, but the reality is that Ashley Madison, just like a whole lot of other dating sites out there (except Ave Maria Singles where the men:women ratio is reversed, and the guys are looking for the Virgin Mary in a 22-year old models body living less than a hundred miles away), fakes womens profiles just to lure men to spend money on the site. Ya dont say. Well, as it turns out, this is not news to the insiders of the dating site industry. Or anyone who has used the sites and has had a miserable experience, truth be told. What sells the service is the promise of happily ever after or no strings attached sex in the case of Ashley Madison. However, the reality is that female user profiles, many times, are manufactured like fishing lures. Ashley Madison has paid people to write profiles, and theyve allowed fake profiles to proliferate on their site, said David Evans, an industry consultant who has contracted with Ashley Madison in the past and has tracked the business of online dating since 2002. Tons of sites are guilty of that. Thats not news. Adult dating and hook-up sites have a serious problem, though, [Ryan Pitcher, who spent two years running afake-profile team for Global Personals] says: While they have no problem attracting interested guys, they absolutely bomb when it comes to women. Some of that has to do with openly misogynist marketing; some of it relates to womens well-conditioned social and sexual roles; much of it has to do with the fact that being a rare woman on a site full of desperate, oversexed, uninhibited dudes is objectively terrible. Whatever the exact cause, on the adult sites Pitcher worked on, real women accounted for less than 2 percent of total profiles. And so he and a 28-person team, working in Global Personals vaguely named admin department, spent their work hours crafting very sexy, very fictional profiles and messaging users from them. Profile-writers made roughly $25,000 a year, with bonuses for hitting certain monthly subscription targets. $25,000 a year to have email and chat conversations with men who are looking for female companionshipmaybe its time to bring back the ice cream social and bowling leagues. At any rate, the wholesale manufacture of online profiles, for dating sites and any number of other online enterprises (think fake Twitter followers), is a big business overseas. Eastern Europe does a lot of this business paying their translators by the message. In the far east, young people sit in cubicles all day taking photos posted online and turning them into somebody elses profile. Sometimes, the people made up actually sound plausible. But, the truth is that online, when it comes to human relations on dating sites, nothing is quite what it sounds like. Buyer beware and all that. And so it is in the latest act of the tragedy that is an oversexed America, that millions of men who fell hook, line and sinker for slick and seductive marketing are now paying the price for wanting quick and easy excitement in their sex lives. All for nothing, too, as most of the profiles of women were faked. The question of whether or not it was worth it has been answered. The better query is how did so many otherwise smart men fall for the scam? \",\n          \" At the time, it became one of the most conspiracy-theorized incidents since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- the downing of TWA Flight 800. In case you haven't heard the story, Flight 800 -- a Boeing 747-100 airliner - blew up and then crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near East Moriches, New York, on July 17, 1996, around 8:30 p.m. EST, 12 minutes after taking off from John F. Kennedy (irony!) International Airport on a scheduled flight to Rome, following a stopover in Paris. All 230 aboard were, of course, killed, making it the third-worst air disaster. The official version of events, according to the FBI and the National Transportation Safety Board, was that a center fuel tank in the plane exploded due to faulty wiring. But others weren't buying that. In fact, the initial FBI investigation worked off the assumption that the plane was brought down by a missile, and the NTSB's final report, which wasn't issued until more than four years later, mentioned as much. Six months after the plane crashed, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, 'All three theories -- a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure -- remain.' That speculation was fed by eyewitness accounts of a sudden explosion preceded by trails of fire arcing upward in the sky. Former NTSB investigator Henry Hughes has said he believes that either a bomb or a missile brought the plane down . 'No, the expert is wrong' Hughes petitioned the NTSB to reopen the case in 2013 but was rebuffed. 'The witness statements, the physical evidence and other facts clearly show there was an explosion external to the aircraft, not the center fuel tank,' he told Reuters . As the 18-year anniversary of the incident approaches, the NTSB has said it would not reopen its investigation; the agency is standing by its conclusion that a hot, faulty wire caused a fuel tank to blow up. But now, suddenly, thanks to the slip of the tongue by a leading television news journalist, the conspiracy has been revived. As noted by Jack Cashill, writing at the American Thinker : Some truths CNN reveals only accidentally. One such truth Anderson Cooper shared on the night of July 17. In speaking about the shoot down of Malaysian airliner MH 17 earlier that day, Cooper referred back to 'July 17, 1996, when TWA Flight 800 was shot down off the coast of Long Island in New York.' You can see the video clip here: YouTube.com . Cashill noted that the fate of TWA Flight 800 was 'fresh on Cooper's mind,' as, two days earlier, Cooper hosted a CNN special report on the incident, titled, 'Witnessed: The Crash of TWA Flight 800.' 'Zoom climb' 'To understand the depth of media-government complicity,' Cashill wrote, 'it is useful to compare 'Witnessed' with two prior videos.' One of them is entitled, ironically, 'No Survivors: Why TWA 800 Could Happen Again.' The network created this special report for the 10th anniversary of the crash in 2006. The second video is a 15-minute shoot produced by the CIA in 1997 which Cashill called 'Zoom Climb.' He further wrote: 'Zoom Climb,' the theatrical highlight of the FBI investigation, was designed to negate the stubborn testimony of the eyewitnesses. An animated sequence in 'Zoom Climb' shows an internal fuel tank explosion blowing the nose off the 747. According to the video's narration, TWA 800 then 'pitched up abruptly and climbed several thousand feet from its last recorded altitude of about 13,800 feet to a maximum altitude of about 17,000 feet.' This rocketing aircraft was alleged to look like a missile and to have confused the eyewitnesses. This animation was essential to close the investigation. Without this zoom climb scenario, the FBI had no way to explain what hundreds of official eyewitnesses had actually seen. In the end, Cooper recanted what he had said [see it here: YouTube.com ]. I just want to correct something I said regarding the plane crash, earlier I said that today was the anniversary of flight TWA 800, crashing off the coast of Long Island in 1996. I believe I said that it was shot down. Obviously, the government said it was a center fuel tank explosion. Although some people indicated they saw a rocket, there was no evidence of that. It was ruled to be a center fuel tank explosion, so I apologize for misspeaking about that anniversary.

Someone, edited it to coincide with a film as he spoke. He used pause, emotional tone and triumphant enhancement of vocal chords in action and read wordswith might. I thought it was spoken very well and clear. When I viewed the images and live clips of the video as he read along, it was truly heart rendering. In the final verses and phases, a true lifeviewingshows whats happening in Europe with the refugee rampages. The story of the snake is a wise wake-up call to our society here in the U.S.. It shows how we are extremely close to becoming the people of Europe if we allow the refugees tocome through our borders. I have to give Mr. Trump a lot of credit for his prose in this poem. My analogy of this poem reads like this, the Vicious Snake could be seen as Barack Hussein Obama an hes begging to let these poor refugees in. Telling the American people that we are a country of immigrants and a charitable nation. I dont have to wonder about his motives and evil manipulative efforts to achieve his ideology of how America should be. I know, I watched how he lied and connived, covered up and had back door meetings at the White House. He Passed laws when Congress was out on break. The corrupt Obama regime, includes IRSs Lois Learner, Hillary R Clinton, the Head of the Dept. Of Veterans Affairs and all the other Washington cronies who brown nose him for promotions, bonuses, trips and money. Remember when he said, I am going to fundamentally change America in 2008? He meant that. Hes been doing that to us on his own agenda, without the will of the people for the past 7 years. Hes lied to us to get his way, just like the Vicious Snake in Trumps video. When the refugees get here, some 100,000 or more of these Muslims, they will imitate the same actions they pulled off in Europe. After theyre here, like theVicious Snake, they bite, they rape, they steal, they dump miles and miles of trash on our landscapes and in our city streets. They will and do resort to crime and proclaim jihad on American soil. The cunning nature of this vicious snake (Obama) just ate up our citizens dreams, values and and security. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Predicted Label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          2,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          2,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is Wong's third gold medal in the road cycling event in four National Games. 'The route is a typical mountain road,' Hong Kong team coach, Shen Jinkang, said. 'It is more difficult than all the previous National Games and any other one-day race of inter-continental competitions.' Only 34 cyclists out of 74 completed Monday's race which was filled with hills and crosswind. Wong finished in five hours 35 minutes and nine seconds, two seconds faster than the runner-up, Chinese Army's Ma Haijun. Li Fuyu from host Shandong Province took the third with 5:35:12. 'It is my last National Games,' the 36-year-old Wong said after the journey, who still looks to compete in the 2012 London Olympics. 'I think I will retire after the London Olympics, and I hope Hong Kong's young cyclists may catch up and get more medals in the future,' he said. \",\n          \" A clear message has been delivered by Chuck Norris: if you cross him, you'll surely hear about it. The recent incident of a Texas man being asked to remove his flag by his landlord, who considered it a threat to the Muslim community, was the last straw for Norris. This followed an incident where a veteran in Florida was fined $8,000 for flying a flag in his yard. Norris questioned the public, \\\"Do you recall the time when Americans were not only proud to display the Old Glory but also disapproved of neighbors who didn't?\\\" He urged everyone to fly the flag proudly and use the opportunity to remind family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors of its significance. In fact, what is unfortunate is that there seems to be some embarrassment surrounding what the United States represents. Many people are starting to view the United States as an aggressor instead of a liberator. These flag-flying incidents would not be so disheartening if they weren't becoming so common and indicative of a United States that has strayed from its original purpose and the intentions of its founders. Let us not hesitate for a moment to place our hand over our heart and declare loudly and proudly for all to hear: \\\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\\\"</s>\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

One city councilwoman decided to resign after she found out that the towns tree lighting would be called a Christmas tree lighting. Charlene Storey told Eyewitness News that she has since taken back her letter of resignation, after meeting with the mayor over the weekend. Although Storey will continue her work for the city, a committee is now set to discuss the official name of the ceremony. Reports indicate that the official name for the ceremony was the holiday tree lighting ceremony. Now, Roselle Park mayor Carl A. Hokanson has decided to change the name of the ceremony to bring Christmas back into the equation. The council supported his decision, voting 4-2 in favor of the change. This is using municipal funds to have an eventthe tree lighting event and so on, Storey argued against the decision. I think if youre using municipal funds, you have to be careful to be representing as large a part of the population as possible. For 64 years of my life, it was a Christmas tree, Mayor Hokanson answered. Thats what it is. I dont mean to offend anybody in any way, shape or form, but it is a Christmas tree. Its not a holiday tree, its not a pear treeits a Christmas tree, and this is the season. What do you think? Do you support Mayor Hokanson for standing behind his belief? \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The fierce row over their exclusion has dominated the campaign for Sunday's vote and sparked accusations that Iraq's 'de-Baathification' programme was being used for political advantage. At the centre of it all is Ali al-Lami, executive director of the Justice and Accountability Committee (JAC) which has barred around 500 candidates from the polls. Controversially, he himself is running in the poll. 'The JAC decisions have been made according to the law,' the 46-year-old father of six insisted. 'Some of them (the barred candidates) are Baathists, and others are working as spies,' he told selfnews. 'All of them are dangerous.' Lami was speaking in the Baghdad home of his friend Ahmed Chalabi, chairman of the JAC, a parliamentary candidate, and the man whose faulty intelligence on weapons of mass destruction spurred the United States to invade Iraq in 2003. He said that on January 1 his committee received from the election commission a list of the names of all 6,500-odd candidates in the poll with the request that their pasts be checked to see if they had any part in the Sunni dictator's oppression of his people. It cross-checked the names with three databases, whose details he did not specify, and built dossiers of candidates' alleged links to the Baath Party, said Lami, who like Chalabi is running on the Iraqi National Alliance slate. Within 10 days, a list of 511 names had been compiled. Twenty-eight have since been reinstated, but political parties have largely either withdrawn the remaining candidates or replaced them with new names. Lami noted that two-thirds of the names on the list were from the majority Shiites, while the remaining third were Sunni. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki quickly embraced the JAC's findings, saying that only 'criminals' and 'murderers' would be affected. Iraq, he added, had 'no intention of reconciling with those who regard... Saddam as a martyr,' referring to the December 2006 hanging of the toppled Iraqi president for crimes against humanity. The row over the bans dominated the election campaign, raising questions about the JACs legal status, the judiciarys independence, the electoral commissions credibility and the ultimate fairness of Sunday's vote. Saleh al-Mutlak, leader of the Sunni National Dialogue Front and the most prominent candidate barred, condemned the JAC, saying last month: 'This is the coup de grace of the political process and the suicide of democracy in Iraq.' Diplomats and analysts have complained of a lack of transparency in the process which led to the bans. They fear the controversy might dissuade some Iraqis from voting. The process has also heightened political tensions in a country which was engulfed by deadly sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007, and comes as the US is set to withdraw half of its troops by the end of August. Lami dismisses charges of a conflict of interest. 'What we do is just like the minister of interior or the minister of education. They also check candidates to make sure they meet requirements,' he said, referring to rules which state that would-be MPs must have completed secondary school and have no criminal record. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Apparently, the thought of releasing five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for an American deserter, Bowe Bergdahl, is not big news to her. Rosenberg argues that the White House has been hinting at the deal, and that it has in fact been in the works for a few years. She claims that it is not surprising that Congress was never officially consulted. Rosenberg does admit, however, that the negotiations took place at an extraordinarily rapid pace. She also speculated that because of the delicate nature of the exchange, the President most likely had legitimate reasons for not informing Congress until the deal was already in progress. The White House and Pentagon intentionally bypassed the 30 day statutory notice requirement that was signed by the President just last year. Obama used executive privilege to avoid the process. According to Rosenberg, Obama was following a precedent that she claims was established by the George Bush Administration.
