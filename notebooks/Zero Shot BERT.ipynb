Its origin was misreported. I.F. Stones Hidden History of the Korean War explained. Monthly Review co-founders Leo Huberman and Paul Sweezy wrote in the preface: This book.paints a very different picture of the Korean War one, in fact, which is at variance with the official version at almost every point. Stones investigative research presented a full-scale reassessment of the whole war. French publisher Claude Bourdet added: If Stones thesis corresponds to reality, we are in the presence of the greatest swindle in the whole of military history.not a question of a harmless fraud but of a terrible maneuver in which deception is being consciously utilized to block peace at a time when it is possible. Stone called it international aggression. So did Huberman and Sweezy, saying: .we have come to the conclusion that (South Korean president) Syngman Rhee deliberately provoked the North Koreans in the hope that they would retaliate by crossing the parallel in force. The northerners fell neatly into the trap. Beating up on North Korea persists. Its done for geopolitical reasons. Washington needs enemies. When none exist theyre created. North Korea comes straight from central casting. On March 11, North Korea cut its hotline with the South. It abrogated the 1953 armistice. It did so as US and South Korean forces began joint exercises. Theyre provocative when held. Days earlier, the Security Council voted new sanctions. They followed Pyongyangs mid-February nuclear test. They targeted its banking and finance system. They froze normal international transactions. They involved other restrictions. North Korea said the US is set to light a fuse for nuclear war. Its military exercise(s) the right to a (defensive) preemptive nuclear attack. Its state-run Rodong Sinmun said the armistice agreement has been nullified. (N)o one can expect what will happen next. South Koreas Defense Ministry responded. Pyongyangs government would evaporate from the face of the earth if it uses nuclear weapons. Newly elected South Korean President Park Guen-hye said We must deal strongly with a North Korean provocation. White House National Security Advisor, Tom Donilon warned: There should be no doubt. We will draw upon the full range of our capabilities to protect against, and to respond to, the threat posed to us and to our allies by North Korea. On March 30, North Korea announced a state of war. It did so with the South. Its rhetoric belies continued policy. Conflict remains unlikely. Its official statement said in part: The moves of the US imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered an extremely grave phase. The Supreme Command of the KPA in its previous statement solemnly declared at home and abroad the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take decisive military counteraction to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership as regards the war moves of the US and south Korean puppets that have reached the most extreme phase. It is the resolute answer of the DPRK and its steadfast stand to counter the nuclear blackmail of the US imperialists with merciless nuclear attack and their war of aggression with just all-out war. Time has come to stage a do-or-die final battle. From this moment, the north-south relations will be put at the state of war and all the issues arousing between the north and the south will be dealt with according to the wartime regulations. The state of neither peace nor war has ended on the Korean Peninsula. .(T)he Korean people will give vent to the pent-up grudge and realize their cherished desire and thus bring a bright day of national reunification and build the best power on this land without fail. White House National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden said: Weve seen reports of a new and unconstructive statement from North Korea. We take these threats seriously and remain in close contact with our South Korean allies. But, we would also note that North Korea has a long history of bellicose rhetoric and threats and todays announcement follows that familiar pattern. No signs of military activity exist. Kaesongs industrial zone remains open. Its operating normally. South Korean companies run it. A war of words continue. Its familiar. Weve seen it all before. Washington bears full responsibility. Obamas Asia pivot involves advancing Americas military footprint. Doing so aggressively is planned. Chinas growing economic might and military strength are targeted. So is checking Russia at the same time. North Koreas a convenient punching bag. They dont come any better. Beating up on Pyongyang is policy. Its longstanding. It shows no signs of ending. It continues ad nauseam. Americas so-called missile defense is for offense. In mid-March, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said additional numbers would be added in Alaska. Others are planned for Asia. In Japan, tracking radar systems were added. China and Russia oppose them. They do so for good reason. Theyre prime targets. Undermining their influence is policy. So is isolating them from neighbors and asserting Washingtons dominance over territories and waters not its own. Washington deployed B-2 stealth bombers to South Korea. They dropped dummy bombs on Jik Do island. US Forces Korea (USFK) said Americas ability to conduct long-range, precision strikes quickly and at will (shall) provide extended deterrence to our allies in the Asia-Pacific region. B-2s are equipped for nuclear bombs and missiles. Capability doesnt reflect policy. North Korea poses Washington and Seoul no threat. On the one hand, US officials suggest it. On the other, saber rattling implies otherwise. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says Pyongyang will amass a nuclear arsenal. Its needed to deter aggression. After B-2s overflew South Korea, Rodong Sinmun said US provocations make American Pacific Rim bases prime targets. Russian analyst Evgeny Kim said introducing B2s openly provok(es) North Korea. Seoul remains calms. Pyongyang takes US threats seriously. At the same time, initiating wars unlikely. Doing so would be suicidal. Potentially, a spark could ignite it. Small incidents at times cause big ones. Another Asian war would be disastrous. China and Russia might intervene. If nuclear weapons are used, all bets are off. Its hard imagining what no head of state should risk. For sure Kim Jong-un wont. At the same time, Obamas Asia pivot makes anything possible. Events bear close watching.

'Lofton loves competitionhe'll try to beat you any way he can,' Lundquist said of Lofton, whose function on the team is to produce points while preventing the other team from doing so in turn.

Appearing on the Fox News Channel, Paul told the host Sean Hannity, Sean, when the American people find out about this scandal, they are going to be shocked, truly shocked. It didnt get a lot of coverage at the time. Asked by Hannity how the scandal could have remained under wraps for so long, Paul replied, Youll have to ask Bill and Hillary that. Lets just say theyve pulled a lot of strings to keep this story out of the mainstream media. Unfortunately for them, Sean, I have the details on this juicy scandal and Im prepared to share them with the American people, he said. I think its going to be a game-changer. While he believes that the shocking revelations about President Clintons Oval Office dalliances will be enough to destroy Hillarys 2016 ambitions, Paul confirmed that he has other arrows in his quiver. It turns out that Hillary was involved in a business deal called Whitewater, he said. When the American people find out about this, its going to blow their minds. \",\n          \"The Commonwealth Games were supposed to be India's grand coming-out party, an audition for a potential Olympic bid and a chance to show off its rising status as a superpower and serious rival to China. But for all of India's high hopes, the games have become a source of national shame. Allegations of fraud, construction delays, budget overruns and security concerns have plagued the games for months. Then a series of incidents this week - including a bridge collapse and descriptions of the athletes' living quarters as filthy - added to India's troubles. Even the theme song for the games was deemed disappointing. Instead of looking scrubbed and polished, roads in the capital are still dug up, piles of rubble hiding unfinished work in what has become a symbol of the gaps between India's aspirations and the realities on the ground. More than 7,000 athletes from 71 nations of the former British Empire are supposed to arrive here by Friday for the Oct. 3-14 games. But some have announced plans to withdraw, and New Zealand and Canada joined Scotland on Thursday in taking a wait-and-see approach. 'The games are officially a disaster. The people of India feel dejected. Instead of boosting our profile, we are now objects of pity around the world,' said Boria Majumdar, a sports historian who has written a national bestseller about the games. 'We have lost our chance at an Olympic bid for 2020. Who will trust India now?' The centerpiece of a jaw-dropping opening ceremony - a $12 million helium balloon -is being hastily rejiggered because of an equipment malfunction, an official said. A smaller inner balloon, fitted with cameras to project images of 5,000 years of Indian culture and India's economic rise, burst in torrential rains and lightning. 'Now it is just a big expensive balloon,' sighed the official. Adding to India's headache, this year's monsoon rains have been the worst in decades. An outbreak of dengue fever, spread by mosquitoes, has killed five people and sickened 2,500 in the capital. India's health minister, Gulam Nabi Azad, said pools of dirty water around construction sites 'have become a breeding place for mosquitoes.' Delhi state government's health minister announced in August that the army would be called in to remove stagnate water from the athletes' village. But the government, worried that the army's presence would create panic, decided against the plan. On Wednesday, the government reversed that decision, saying the army and the air force were desperately needed to pump water out of the village, which the chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation called 'unfit for human habitation.' The monsoon has lasted longer than expected, bringing into question India's selection of October for the event in the first place. 'Elections, marriages and sporting events - we all know in India that these are best held in the month of November,' after the rains, said M.S. Gill, India's sports minister. Officials are praying for a night without rain so they can finish work. Workers at the main stadium received letters on Tuesday saying they would have to work seven days a week for more than 11 hours a day, a violation of the games' labor laws. 'The only legacy of the games would be the realization that we are not a modern nation,' said a high-ranking consultant to the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his comments would jeopardize his job. A portion of the ceiling at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main venue for the games, collapsed Wednesday, a day after a footbridge near the stadium crashed down, injuring 27 construction workers, six critically. The same day, several star athletes - including England's world champion triple jumper Phillips Idowu - pulled out of the games after hearing about the conditions at the athletes' village. Security concerns were heightened Sunday when gunmen fired on a tourist bus at the city's historic mosque, injuring two visitors. The gunmen remain at large. 'It's enough to have to worry about performing, but to worry where you sleep and walk is another thing,' said Dani Samuels, an Australian discus world champion who withdrew this week. In an effort to save the games, Mike Fennell, the federation's president, arrived Thursday for a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose office took over the city's preparations last month. Oscar winner A.R. Rahman, a national hero for his 'Slumdog Millionaire' hit song 'Jai Ho,' was paid $1 million to compose the game's theme song. But critics said it lacked the energy of Shakira's 'Waka Waka,' the World Cup anthem. 'A double whammy of embarrassment and humiliation,' the Indian Express newspaper wrote. 'Games India's Shame,' read a front-page headline in the Times of India. Defenders of India's effort say the setbacks are the normal growing pains for a rising nation that will soon surprise the world and show it can pull the games off. They point to several major projects that were completed on time. A new international airport terminal has received rave reviews along with a clean and speedy subway. 'What the Olympic Games did for Beijing, the Commonwealth Games will do for Delhi. It will become a world-class city,' said Suresh Kalmadi, president of the Commonwealth Games Organizing Committee. 'India is the flavor of the season. We want to show that Delhi can be a great sporting hub.' Many Indians have complained about the cost of hosting the games, with estimates ranging from $3 billion to more than $10 billion. In 2003, India said it would spend less than $100 million. There have also been countless charges of corruption and bribes, which the prime minister's office said it is investigating. After weeks of uproar on the streets and in Parliament, the government admitted last month that more than $130 million allocated for poverty reduction programs had been diverted to projects related to the games. 'Financially, the games are a major fiasco,' said Norris Pritam, an Indian sports journalist who has covered the Olympics and Asian Games. 'It has damaged India's reputation, especially abroad. My main worry is that the world will be afraid to put their money in India.' During an official tour of the flagship stadium last week, Kalmadi proclaimed the venue '100 percent ready,' even as workers banged and metal clanged near him. 'This is just last-minute polishing and a little bit of cleaning going on' to keep the workers occupied, he said over the noise. 'Otherwise, what will they do?' \",\n          \"A female Belgian skydiver went on trial for murder Friday, accused of allegedly killing the woman who was both her good friend and her lover's paramour by sabotaging the woman's parachute. The prosecutors said jealousy drove Els Clottemans to kill Els Van Doren four years ago by turning their shared passion for skydiving into a murder weapon. Clottemans, 26, has vehemently denied the murder charges and accusations that she killed Van Doren so she could have the man, another Dutch skydiver, all to herself. Belgian privacy laws make it impossible to identify him. The case has captured the imagination of this nation since Van Doren fell from 13,000 feet (4,500 meters) into a suburban garden in eastern Belgium after both her parachute and her reserve parachute did not open on Nov. 18, 2006. A married mother of two and an experienced skydiving enthusiast, Van Doren had jumped from a plane together with Clottemans, their Dutch lover and another skydiver intending to perform tricks in the sky. Clottemans, however, jumped a fraction too late and did not join the maneuvers with the other three. When the sign was given to open the parachutes, Van Doren struggled with her cords before hurling toward the ground. Clottemans became a prime suspect when she attempted suicide hours before she was to make a second statement to police a month after the incident. The investigation revealed that Clottemans had a relationship with the same skydiver as Van Doren. Prosecutors allege that Clottemans had tampered with Van Doren's parachute and cut two vital cords before the jump. No hard evidence has surfaced so far to support the murder charge, but prosecutors hope the circumstantial links will secure a conviction. Chief defense lawyer Vic Van Aelst said prosecutors 'have nothing' to tie his client to the death. 'They have to prove they have something, but they have been trying to do it for four years and it is not going very well for them,' Vic Van Aelst said. The trial opened Friday with jury selection and is expected to last a month. Media interest was so extensive that authorities used a room next to the courthouse so journalists could follow the proceedings through remote video. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

[SEP]\",\n          \"[CLS] a female belgian skydiver went on trial for murder friday, accused of allegedly killing the woman who was both her good friend and her lover's paramour by sabotaging the woman's parachute. the prosecutors said jealousy drove els clottemans to kill els van doren four years ago by turning their shared passion for skydiving into a murder weapon. clottemans, 26, has vehemently denied the murder charges and accusations that she killed van doren so she could have the man, another dutch skydiver, all to herself. belgian privacy laws make it impossible to identify him. the case has captured the imagination of this nation since van doren fell from 13, 000 feet ( 4, 500 meters ) into a suburban garden in eastern belgium after both her parachute and her reserve parachute did not open on nov. 18, 2006. a married mother of two and an experienced skydiving enthusiast, van doren had jumped from a plane together with clottemans, their dutch lover and another skydiver intending to perform tricks in the sky. clottemans, however, jumped a fraction too late and did not join the maneuvers with the other three. when the sign was given to open the parachutes, van doren struggled with her cords before hurling toward the ground. clottemans became a prime suspect when she attempted suicide hours before she was to make a second statement to police a month after the incident. the investigation revealed that clottemans had a relationship with the same skydiver as van doren. prosecutors allege that clottemans had tampered with van doren's parachute and cut two vital cords before the jump. no hard evidence has surfaced so far to support the murder charge, but prosecutors hope the circumstantial links will secure a conviction. chief defense lawyer vic van aelst said prosecutors'have nothing'to tie his client to the death.'they have to prove they have something, but they have been trying to do it for four years and it is not going very well for them,'vic van aelst said. the trial opened friday with jury selection and is expected to last a month. media interest was so extensive that authorities used a room next to the courthouse so journalists could follow the proceedings through remote video.
